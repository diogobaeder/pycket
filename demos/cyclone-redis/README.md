# Cyclone Redis Demo

See [github/firoix/cyclone] for the latest source.

## About

This demonstrates integrating [pycket] with [cyclone], using a redis backend (but easily switched to using memcached).

[Cyclone] is a clone of facebook's [Tornado], on top of [Twisted].

Although cyclone and tornado are very similar, cyclone leverages all
enterprise class features of Twisted, and more. It is extremely stable, and
ready for production.
